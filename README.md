It is a challenging task to generate accurate captions for an image in field of Artificial Intelligence. The question is Why do we need it? Due to its plethora of applications ranging from helping the visually impaired to robotic vision, this topic has been of great interest for researchers. As the name suggests, the aim of the project is to build an optimal system which can generate grammatically and semantically correct descriptions or captions for an image. The objective of the study is to detect all the objects and attributes, recognise relationship among them and then generate captions describing all the features present in image using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. The aim of the project is to generate a textual description and convert them to audio when an image is passed as an input to it.
